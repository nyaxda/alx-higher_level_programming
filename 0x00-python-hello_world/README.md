# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

The following were the learning objectives:
-   Why Python programming is awesome
-   Why indentation is so important in Python
-   How to use the  `if`,  `if ... else`  statements
-   How to use comments
-   How to affect values to variables
-   How to use the  `while`  and  `for`  loops
-   How is Python’s  `for`  different from  `C`‘s?
-   How to use the  `break`  and  `continues`  statements
-   How to use  `else`  clauses on loops
-   What does the  `pass`  statement do, and when to use it
-   How to use  `range`
-   What is a function and how do you use functions
-   What does return a function that does not use any  `return`  statement
-   Scope of variables
-   What’s a traceback
-   What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

The following are the files and their respective functions in this repository:
1. 0-positive_or_negative.py - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
2. 1-last_digit.py - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
3. 2-print_alphabet.py - program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. 3-print_alphabt.py - program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
5. 4-print_hexa.py - program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal
6. 5-print_comb2.py - program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`.
7. 6-print_comb3.py - program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

15. 101-remove_char_at.py - function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
16. 102-magic_calculation.py -  Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
