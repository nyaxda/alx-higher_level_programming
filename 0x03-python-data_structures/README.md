-   What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
-   How to use lists as stacks and queues
-   What are list comprehensions and how to use them
-   What are tuples and how to use them
-   When to use tuples versus lists
-   What is a sequence
-   What is tuple packing
-   What is sequence unpacking
-   What is the  `del`  statement and how to use it

The following are the files and their respective functions in this repository:
1. 0-print_list_integer.py - function that prints all integers of a list.
2. 1-element_at.py - function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
3. 2-replace_in_list.py - function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
4. 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py - function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
5. 4-new_in_list.py - function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
6. 5-no_c.py - function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.
7. 6-print_matrix_integer.py - function that prints a matrix of integers.
8. 7-add_tuple.py - function that adds 2 tuples.
9. 8-multiple_returns.py - function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
10. 9-max_integer.py - function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
11.  10-divisible_by_2.py - function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
12. 11-delete_at.py - function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
13. 12-switch.py - function that switches values of `a` and `b`
14. 13-is_palindrome.c, lists.h - function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
15. 100-print_python_list_info.c - C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
